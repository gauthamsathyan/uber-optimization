# uber-optimization

## Project Description

This project focuses on enhancing the customer service process of Uber, improving its overall efficiency, and refining the user experience. The objective is to leverage data science methodologies to boost driver matching, refine arrival time predictions, and streamline customer support processes. Additionally, we employ the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to identify the most suitable city in Canada for launching new features in the Uber app.

## Major Focus Areas

1. **Enhancing Driver Matching:** Detailed statistical analysis of demand-related data patterns, including the day of the week and ride durations, were performed. K-means and DBSCAN clustering techniques were employed to recognize temporal patterns and activity levels. These insights are used to better predict demand, optimize supply, and improve overall customer service.

2. **Improving Arrival Time Estimates:** Extensive analysis of historical data was performed, considering variables like traffic, distance, time of day, and day of the week. After comparing multiple regression models, it was found that the KNeighborsRegressor model provided the most accurate results, as measured by Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

3. **Enhancing Efficiency of Customer Support:** By leveraging BERT-based text classification and automated response generation, we automated the customer service process for Uber. The main aim is to efficiently categorize customer complaints and generate relevant automated responses tailored to each complaint category, leading to improved resolution efficiency and a smoother customer support experience for Uber users.

4. **Choosing Optimal City for New Feature Launch:** An in-depth AHP process was used to select the optimal city for launching a new feature in the Uber app. Cities were evaluated based on criteria such as population, income, and transportation. The process concluded that Toronto was the best choice for this expansion due to its high overall score in the AHP-based analysis.
